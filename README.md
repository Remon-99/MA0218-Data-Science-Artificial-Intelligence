<h1>MA0218 Data Science & AI Project: Earthquake Resilience Modeling</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In our MA0218 Introduction to Data Science & Artificial Intelligence project, my partner and I explored diverse machine
learning techniques beyond Linear Regression. Employing Python, we utilized Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support
Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, Principal Component Analysis, K-Means Clustering,
and Gradient Boosting. Each technique brought unique strengths to our analysis of a 50,000-entry dataset from the Nepal
Earthquake, enhancing our ability to identify and prioritize key factors influencing a building's earthquake resilience.
